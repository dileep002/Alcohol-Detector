# Alcohol-Detector

<div style="text-align: justify;">
This project focuses on creating a simple alcohol detection system using an Arduino microcontroller and an MQ-3 alcohol sensor. The purpose of this system is to detect alcohol vapors in the air and alert the user if the alcohol concentration exceeds a certain level. The system can be useful in various real-world scenarios, such as vehicle safety, workplace monitoring, and personal alcohol testing.

The system works by measuring alcohol content in the air. The MQ-3 sensor detects alcohol vapors, which cause a change in the sensor’s electrical resistance. The Arduino then reads this change and processes it as an analog voltage that corresponds to the alcohol concentration in the air. If the alcohol level goes above a certain threshold, the system triggers both an LED and a buzzer. The buzzer provides an audible warning, and the LED gives a visual signal, making it easy for the user to understand and respond to.

When powered on, the alcohol sensor needs a short warm-up time to stabilize and provide accurate readings. The system runs on a 5V power supply, making it easy to connect to the Arduino, which can be powered by either USB or a battery. This portability makes it suitable for many different uses. For instance, it can be used in vehicles to monitor a driver’s alcohol level, preventing impaired driving. In workplaces, especially those involving safety-sensitive tasks, it can ensure employees aren’t under the influence before beginning work.

The MQ-3 sensor is quite effective at detecting alcohol vapors, but it requires proper calibration to ensure accurate results. The system’s alert threshold can be adjusted based on the user’s needs, such as a specific Blood Alcohol Concentration (BAC) or sensitivity level. The Arduino’s flexibility allows for further enhancements, like adding an LCD display to show the alcohol concentration or integrating a relay to control other devices, like a vehicle’s ignition system.

Overall, this project shows how Arduino and sensors can be used to build affordable, real-time monitoring systems. By using basic input and output components, it provides a low-cost solution for alcohol detection that can be applied in various settings. Whether you’re a hobbyist, student, or engineer, this project highlights how versatile and powerful Arduino can be for creating practical, everyday solutions.
